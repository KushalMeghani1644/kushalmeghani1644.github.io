# Kushal Meghani

This is my **vibe-coded Next.js website** — because I’m still figuring out web dev 😅.

## What do I even do?

I am a backend + bare-metal Rust dev who loves and contributes to OSS repositories like RISC-V, and Tauri, I have a wide range of contributions on github and am still learning and getting better.... to know more about me visit my website at: kushalmeghani1644-github-io.vercel.app


Built with ❤️ in Next.js and ShadCN.
